# Agentic Tutor Templates

This repository contains two comprehensive template files that create effective AI tutoring experiences:

- **`MASTER_PLAN.md`** - A structured framework for designing learning sessions
- **`tutor_behaviour_guide.md`** - Detailed behavioral guidelines for consistent tutoring

## 🚀 How to Use These Tools

### 1. Set Up Your AI Tutor
Provide both template files to your AI assistant along with your learning request. The AI will use these as instructions for how to conduct the tutoring session.

### 2. Start a Learning Session
Simply ask the AI to help you learn something specific, for example:
- "I want to learn React hooks for job interviews"
- "Help me understand database design for my startup"
- "Teach me GraphQL for my current project"

### 3. The AI Will Follow This Process:
1. **Ask clarifying questions** about your goals and context
2. **Research current best practices** for your topic
3. **Design a practical micro-project** related to your needs
4. **Create a structured learning plan** with phases and micro-tasks
5. **Guide you through hands-on implementation** (you code, AI guides)
6. **Provide feedback and reflection** at each step

## 📁 Critical: Keep Generated Files in Context

When the AI starts your learning session, it will create a folder structure like:
```
learning_session_[timestamp]/
├── learning_plan.md          # Your complete learning roadmap
├── logs.md                  # Progress tracking and insights
├── references.md            # All web sources and documentation
├── mini_detour.md           # Temporary files for concept gaps
├── MASTER_PLAN.md           # Copy of the tutor framework
└── tutor_behaviour_guide.md # Copy of behavior guidelines
```

**🚨 IMPORTANT: Keep ALL these files in your AI conversation context throughout the entire learning session.**

### Why This Matters:
- **Continuity**: The AI maintains context across the session
- **Progress Tracking**: logs.md keeps track of what you've learned
- **Reference**: The AI can refer back to your goals and progress
- **Consistency**: Behavior guidelines ensure consistent tutoring approach
- **Recovery**: If the conversation is interrupted, you can resume from where you left off

## 🎯 What to Expect

### The AI Will:
- ✅ **Guide you to implement** core concepts yourself
- ✅ **Ask "How would you approach this?"** before solutions
- ✅ **Test your code immediately** after you write it
- ✅ **Give honest feedback** about mistakes (learning happens through correction)
- ✅ **Adapt difficulty** based on your competence level
- ✅ **Connect everything** to your specific goals and use case
- ✅ **Update documentation** throughout the session

### The AI Will NOT:
- ❌ Write your core implementation code
- ❌ Give direct answers without making you think
- ❌ Move forward without your understanding
- ❌ Skip testing and validation steps
- ❌ Let mistakes slide without correction

## 🔧 Session Management Tips

### Before Starting:
- Have a clear learning goal and motivation
- Know roughly how much time you have available
- Be prepared to actively implement (not just watch)

### During the Session:
- Keep all generated files accessible to the AI
- Engage with reflection questions honestly
- Don't hesitate to ask for clarification
- Implement the code yourself - resist the urge to ask the AI to do it

### If You Need to Resume:
- Provide the AI with all files from your learning session folder
- Briefly mention where you left off
- The logs.md file will help the AI understand your progress

## 🎨 Customization Options

These are **template files** - you can modify them to better fit your:
- **Subject matter** (not just programming)
- **Learning style** preferences  
- **Time constraints**
- **Teaching approach** preferences
- **Specific domains** or industries

### Key Areas to Customize:

#### Learning Goals Framework
- Modify clarification questions for your subject
- Adjust goal alignment criteria
- Customize success metrics

#### Task Structure  
- Change micro-task sizes (currently ≤10 lines for coding)
- Adapt testing/validation approaches for your domain
- Modify reflection questions

#### Feedback Approach
- Adjust the directness level of feedback
- Customize mistake-correction processes  
- Modify encouragement patterns

#### Documentation System
- Adapt the logging structure
- Customize progress tracking methods
- Modify reference documentation format

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Learn React" vs "Learn React hooks for building a chat app for job interviews"
2. **Stay Engaged**: The AI will ask you to implement - don't ask it to do the work
3. **Embrace Mistakes**: The system is designed to help you learn from errors
4. **Trust the Process**: The structured approach leads to deeper understanding
5. **Keep Files**: Always maintain the learning session folder in context

## 🔄 Remember

These templates create a **guided discovery experience** where you learn by doing, not by being told. The AI acts as a coach who sets up the environment, asks the right questions, and helps you when you're stuck - but you do the actual learning and implementation.
